# UrlShortner

This project was built to become more familiar with Amazon Web Services, more specifically with Serverless Application Model. In here, we build a URL Shortner using [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to build a stack composed by [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) powered by [DAX](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/).
